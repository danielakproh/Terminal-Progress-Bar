# Terminal-Progress-Bar

We all know how frustrating it can be to not be able to monitor the progress of a script; whether that's web scraping or socket programming, being able to follow along with the execution of the code can be a good way to debug or ensure things do work as expected. so I have designed a progress bar which can be implemented in most applications (if done properly)

# Instructions

1. [Download](https://github.com/pythonis-dan/Terminal-Progress-Bar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the Github Repository

2. Download and install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) if necessary.

3. I have included a sample usage of the progress bar to give you an idea on how it can be implemented

This project welcomes contribution from anyone that's interested in improving it. If you have any questions regarding this project or anything about programming in general, feel free to reach out to me, I'll be glad to help. Have fun!
